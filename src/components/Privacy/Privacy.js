            <p>
                We may collect information, including personal data, directly from you if you choose to provide that
                information. For example, you
                may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or
                other details of that nature, when you sign up for our
                newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also may choose to provide personally identifiable information about yourself when you participate
                in forums or discussions on the Site. Please be
                aware that information you post in these forums may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site,
                therefore you should avoid posting sensitive
                personal data that you would not want to be available to the public.
