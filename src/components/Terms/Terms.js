        <p><strong>1. Accepting the Terms</strong></p>

        <p>By using the information, tools, features, software and functionality including content, updates and new releases provided by Intuit of the Mint Services or the Bill Payment Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Mint.com website), or a “Customer” (which means that you have registered for an account with us to use any one of our Services.) The term “you” or “User” refers to a Visitor, Member or Customer. The term “we” refers to Intuit. If you wish to become a Customer or want to make use of the Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the registration process.</p>

        <p>You may not use any of the Services and you may not accept this Agreement if you are not legally authorized to accept and be bound by these terms or are not at least 18 years of age and, in any event, of a legal age to form a binding contract with Intuit.</p>

        <p>Before you continue, you should print or save a local copy of this Agreement for your records.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Privacy and your Personal Information</strong></p>

        <p><strong>3. Description of the Services</strong></p>

        <p>The Mint Service is a personal finance information management service that allows you to consolidate and track your financial information. The Mint Service is provided to you by Intuit without charge (it is free) and is meant to provide you with your information to allow you to organize and manage your finances.</p>

        <p>The Mint Service may also include a service that provides your one-bureau credit summary, credit score and monitoring alerts (“Credit Score Service”). You may have the option to obtain this Credit Score Service for free or elect to purchase an upgraded version of this service that provides you information from multiple credit bureaus (“Mint Credit Monitoring”).</p>

        <p>The Bill Payment Services offers various tools and functions through the Sites including a personal information management service that allows you to consolidate and track certain personal information. It also includes a bill payment service that allows you to make payments to third parties as further described in Section 25 below.</p>

        <p>The Services may also present you information relating to third party products or services (“Intuit Offers”) that you may be interested in. The Services may also provide you general tips, recommendations and educational material.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Account Information from Third Party Sites</strong></p>

        <p>Users may direct Intuit to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-parties with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). Intuit works with one or more online service providers to access this Account Information. Intuit does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Intuit is not responsible for the Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites.</p>

        <p>Intuit cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. Intuit cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Services, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Services, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Intuit Offers and Third-Party Links</strong></p>

        <p>Some parts of the Services are supported by sponsored links from advertisers. The Services may display Intuit Offers that may be custom matched to you based on information stored in the Services, queries made through the Services or other information. We may disclose when a particular Intuit Offer is sponsored or otherwise provided by a third party.</p>


        <p><strong>6. Your Registration Information and Electronic Communications</strong></p>

        <p>In order to allow you to use the Services, you will need to sign up for an account with Intuit. We may verify your identity. You authorize us to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity. These inquiries may include asking you for further information, requiring you to provide your full address, your date of birth, your social security number and/or requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report, or verifying information you provide against third party databases or through other sources. If you do not provide this information or Intuit cannot verify your identity, we can refuse to allow you to use the Services.</p>

        <p>You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password which, together with your LoginID e-mail address, allows you to access the Sites. That LoginID and password, together with any mobile number or other information you provide form your “Registration Information.” By providing us with your e-mail address, you consent to receive all required notices and information. Electronic communications may be posted on the Services site and/or delivered to your e-mail address that we have on file for you. It is your responsibility to promptly update us with your complete, accurate contact information, or change your information, including email address, as appropriate. Notices will be provided in HTML (or, if your system does not support HTML, in plain-text) in the text of the e-mail or through a link to the appropriate page on our site, accessible through any standard, commercially available internet browser. Your consent to receive communications electronically is valid until you end your relationship with us.</p>

        <p>You may print a copy of any electronic communications and retain it for your records. We reserve the right to terminate or change how we provide electronic communications and will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with applicable law.</p>

        <p>If you believe that your Registration or Account Information or device that you use to access the Services has been lost or stolen, that someone is using your account without your permission, or that an Unauthorized Transfer (as defined in Section 25.1 Bill Payment Services below) has occurred, you must notify us immediately in order to minimize your possible losses.</p>
